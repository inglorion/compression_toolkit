compression_toolkit - implementations of various data compression methods

This project contains example implementations of various data
compression methods. The compression methods are described in more
detail at http://inglorion.net/documents/essays/data_compression/

The implementations come with tests that serve the dual purpose of
illustrating how they can be used and verifying that they work as
expected. These tests can be run with
